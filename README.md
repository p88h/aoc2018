p88h Advent of Code 2018
========================

This is a repository containing solutions for the 2018 Advent of Code
(https://adventofcode.com/2018).

This years language of choice is Go. This directory contains multiple dayX files, a single file per day, 
plus a common runner in main.go (and some shared VM code in aocvm.go)

If you would like to run this your self, you can do it like so, from the top-level 
directory of the project:

```
$ go build
$ ./aoc2018
352
$ ./aoc2018 22
Day 22 Part 1: 6318
Day 22 Part 2: 1075
```

(Passing a number as argument runs that specific day)
